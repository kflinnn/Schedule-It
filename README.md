# Schedule-It

## Purpose

A calendar application that allows the user to add important events to a daily planner so that they may manage their time effectively during the work day.

When the user opens the planner the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar. When they scroll down they are presented with time blocks for standard business hours and each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. When the user clicks the time block, they are able to enter an event and cllick the save button corresponding with that time block which then saves the text in local storage. When the page is refreshed, the saved event persists. This was all achieved in JavaScript using web APIs, such as jQuery, Bootstrap, and Google Fonts, event listeners, day.js, conditional statements, arrays, loops, and many other elements and methods. 

## Examples

Save Button function to save to local storage, use of jQuery:
